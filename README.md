# spottyegg frontend test

Here is a simple frontend test to be part of a spottyegg project frontend team.
You do not need to finish the assigment, take about 1h if you don't get to the end dont worry, just skip to task 4 and give your opinion and we can discuss blockers during the interview.

## Test paramters

* Fork then install the project localy (npm i)
* Make your fork private then share it with @etiennea
* Have a look around the prototype
* Task1: Add a profile page that is missing, be creative. (these shouldn't be functional, this is more a product design task, add some typical things that would be on a profile)
* Task2: Add a simple register / login page. Use https://reqres.in for the backend. These should be almost functional but do not need to be perfect, think about how server communication should work.
* Task3: Test your login / register page using cypress
* Task4: Write a few sentences on what you would do different or better if you had more time and give your thoughts on the tech stack and file structure. Feedback on the test is also useful.

## What we will look at

* File structure, code organisation
* Commits, fequency & commit names

## NPM Scripts

* ðŸ”¥ `start` - run development server
* ðŸ”§ `dev` - run development server
* ðŸ”§ `build-dev` - build web app using development mode (faster build without minification and optimization)
* ðŸ”§ `build-prod` - build web app for production

## Cordova

Don't worry about this for the test, or even building just has to work on dev.
